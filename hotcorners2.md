TotalSpaces2 allows you to set a hot corner for opening the Overview Grid, the birds-eye view of your desktops. You can also set a hotcorner to toggle the windows exposé mode once in the overview grid, or to directly open the grid in exposé mode.

A hotcorner works simply by bringing your mouse down to the corner you have selected.

You can also dismiss the overview grid or exposé by triggering the hot corner once again.
