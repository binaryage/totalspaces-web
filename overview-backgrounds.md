TotalSpaces allows you to configure the kind of backgrounds that are shown in the [overview grid](/overview). Find the setting in general preferences.

If you choose to use hi resolution images the backgrounds will look sharper, but it may take a little longer to bring up the grid if you have more than one monitor.

In those situations it is recommended to choose either the Blurred or None setting.

Also, you may find it easier to see your windows with one of these two settings.
