TotalSpaces allows you to set a hot corner for opening the Overview Grid, the birds-eye view of your desktops.

A hotcorner allows you to trigger the overview just by bringing your mouse down to the corner you have selected.

Hotcorners currently look at your monitor setup, and choose the leftmost (for the left corners) or rightmost (for right corners) monitor screen to place the corners in.

You can also dismiss the overview grid by triggering the hot corner once again.
