TotalSpaces helps you if you have multiple monitors connected. The layout of your monitors is shown in the [overview grid](/overview "overview grid"), and you can drag windows between them.

Here there is a grid of 3 columns x 2 rows, and the larger monitor is arranged to the left.

Because the monitor screens are shown together on your main display, you can easily drag windows between each of your monitors.
