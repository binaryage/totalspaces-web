TotalSpaces allows you to bring up an overview of all the desktops in your main grid by triggering a configurable [hotkey](/hotkeys) or by triggering a [hot corner](/hotcorners)

When the overview is visible you can navigate to a new desktop by either using the cursor keys, and the enter key to select, or choosing by clicking on a desktop.

You can also organise your windows by dragging them from desktop to desktop.

If you drag a window from one desktop to another, it will automatically put itself in the same position in the new desktop.

But you can also move windows about in their own desktop, by dragging a window to where you want it to be.
