TotalSpaces allows you to bring up an overview of all the desktops in your main grid by triggering a configurable [hotkey](/hotkeys) or by triggering a [hot corner](/hotcorners). The overview is an excellent way to manage your windows and desktops.

When the overview is visible you can navigate to a new desktop by either using the cursor keys, and the enter key to select, or choosing by clicking on a desktop.

You can also organise your windows by dragging them from desktop to desktop, and putting them just where you want them.

When dragging a window from one desktop to another, you choose to have the system place the window in the same place on the new desktop (as it was in the previous desktop), or to just leave it where you dropped it. This setting is in the General preferences pane.

When you move windows within one desktop, they will always stay where you put them no matter which way you have set the setting.

Note that there are some places where windows cannot be placed - for instance where the title bar of the window is not on the screen.
