## TotalSpaces2 provides a grid of spaces on your Mac

<img src="/images/grid-view.png">

An easy to use 2D grid of desktops. Navigate using the cursor keys (by default together with SHIFT-ALT), choose your [transitions](/transitions2), and quickly access a [birds eye view](/overview2) of your grid of spaces where you can manage your application windows. You can even give your spaces names.

Having a grid of spaces allows you to keep a mental picture of where each of your applications is, and to navigate easily and quickly between them.

TotalSpaces2 lives in an icon in your menu bar, like this:

From there, you can control TotalSpaces2, and access the preferences where you can [set up your grid](/layout2), name your spaces, and configure your desktops just how you like them.

TotalSpaces2 allows you to easily navigate between your spaces, by [**swiping**](/swipe2), with [**hotkeys**](/hotkeys2), or by just moving your mouse the the edge of the screen in the direction you wish to move.

You'll see a helpful notification as you move between your spaces.
