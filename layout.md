You select your desired layout using the selector in the preferences panel.

Just click on the grid to choose any dimensions you wish. Here, I have selected 4 columns x 2 rows.

If you choose a layout that requires you to set up more desktops, TotalSpaces will prompt you to do this.

Pressing the button will automatically add the desktops for you. You can also add desktops in mission control if you wish.

## Removing desktops

At present you can't remove desktops from within TotalSpaces.

To remove desktops, use mission control. Usually this can be accessed with a three fingered swipe upwards, or whichever hotkey you have set for it in System Preferences. Hover your mouse over the desktop you want to remove, and then click on the X to remove the desktop.
