Instead of having a single row of desktops, TotalSpaces lets you define a grid that you can navigate using up, down, left and right shortcuts (by default mapped to crtl-shift-cursor keys).

By using this grid, you can very quickly move between the desktops you commonly use, and using a [hotkey](/hotkeys "Hotkeys") or [hot corner](/hotcorners "Hot corners") you can get a [birds-eye overview](/overview) of all of your desktops.

You select your desired layout using the selector in the preferences panel.

Just click on the grid to choose any dimensions you wish. Here, I have selected 3 columns x 3 rows.

Notice also that you can select to have your Dashboard to the left of your grid, and any full screen apps to the right.
With these options turned on, you can access those desktops using the left or right hotkeys as you would any other desktops in your grid.
You can only select to have the dashboard on the left if you have chosen "Show dashboard as a space" in Mission Control preferences in System preferences.

## Adding desktops

If you choose a layout that requires you to set up more desktops, TotalSpaces will prompt you to do this.

Pressing the button will automatically add the desktops for you. You can also add desktops in mission control if you wish.

## Removing desktops

If you select a layout with fewer desktops than you actually have, TotalSpaces will offer you the option to remove the unused desktops.

When you click on Remove desktops, the highest numbered desktops will be removed.

## Naming desktops and direct hotkeys

Hold down the ctrl key and click on the blue buttons to name your spaces, and to set a hotkey. The names show up in the notification when you change space, in the TotalSpaces menu, and in Mission Control.
