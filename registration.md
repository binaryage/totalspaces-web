## Thanks for considering buying TotalSpaces

This should be really straight-forward. It should take less than 5 minutes in most cases.

## Buy a license from [the web store](https://sites.fastspring.com/switchstep/instant/totalspaces)

<div class="note">Please note that there is no point in ordering 2 licenses, because they cost the same as 3 licenses.</div>

## Wait for an email with "TotalSpaces License" in the subject

In most cases you should get it instantly after the payment.

We all know that even important emails can sometimes end up in a spam folder. Please double check your spam before you [report a missing email](mailto:stephen@binaryage.com). I'm using [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com) which is rock-solid, so a mistake by our mail robots is unlikely.

In Mail.app the message looks like this:

<a name="dialog"></a>
## Enter your license into the Registration Dialog

Use the menu from the status bar icon and choose About / Registration button.

Please make sure you copy and paste license information from the email exactly and without surrounding quotes. 

Click Register and you get this happy screen if you did it right:

Thank you for registering and enjoy using TotalSpaces!
