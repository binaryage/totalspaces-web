You can select whether to use transitions, and which type and the speed they go in the Transitions preferences.

If you want the fastest possible desktop switching experience, turn transitions off.

Most people use Slide or Cube transitions, but the Swap and Flip settings are useful too.

Note that there are some known issues with transitions, particularly with 'black blocking' and that occasionally the transition is not shown, see the [FAQ](/faq).
