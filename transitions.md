You can select whether to use transitions - the animation that is shown when you change desktop - and which type and the speed they go in the Transitions preferences.

Some people prefer to turn the transitions off altogether, and this provides the fastest possible way of changing desktops.

If you like the transitions (and I do), I recommend you use Slide or Cube transitions. But the Swap and Flip settings are useful too - try them out!

The transitions will reinforce the impression that your desktops are in a grid, and help you to remember where each application is.

Also see the [FAQ](/faq) where there is some additional information about transition animations.

The transitions preferences pane is also where you configure [swiping gestures](/swipe) and [using the mouse](/mouse-edges) to trigger space changes.
