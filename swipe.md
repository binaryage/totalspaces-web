You can select in the general preferences pane to enable finger swiping on your trackpad to change desktops.

After you have turned this on, you can use the trackpad to move between the desktops in your grid.

Use your fingers to move up, down, left and right.

It's important to note that the system also uses three and four finger swipes, and you should disable these if you find it interferes with TotalSpaces.

We do at least recommend that you turn off the Launchpad and Show desktop gestures in Trackpad preferences if you use this feature because they are reasonably easy to trigger by mistake.

There's an <a href="/faq">FAQ about why we recommend 5 fingers</a>.
