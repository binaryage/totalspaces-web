**Good news!** [TotalSpaces2](/index2) has been released for Mavericks.

There are too many changes under the hood (and on the surface) in Mavericks, and TotalSpaces was significantly re-engineered inside to handle this. There are [some changes](/differences2) from TotalSpaces, but it's just as good as TotalSpaces, and you can still enjoy your grid-based workflows.

You can [**download it here**](/changes2), and you can [upgrade your TotalSpaces licence here](/upgrade).

Please report any bugs or problems to support@binaryage.com, or get help in the [forums](http://discuss.binaryage.com)
