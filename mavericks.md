**Good news!** We plan to bring TotalSpaces to Mavericks.

It won't be exactly the same, there are too many changes under the hood (and on the surface) in Mavericks. But it will be just as good, and you will still be able to enjoy your grid-based workflows.

For those who have installed the Mavericks pre-release, we'll put up a beta as soon as we have something that you can test.
