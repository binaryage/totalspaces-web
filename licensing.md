## Trial Version

<div class="license-desk">
During the beta period, you may use TotalSpaces without charge, but you can choose to buy a license if you wish.
Once version 1.0.0 is reached, you may install TotalSpaces and use it in trial mode for 14 days. Then you need to decide to buy it or uninstall it.
</div>

The trial, and beta version may be used with full functionality.

In version 1.0.0 and thereafter, after 14 days it starts showing the unregistered text:

<img src="/images/spaces-unregistered.png" class="doc-inline-image" style="left: 0px; margin-bottom: -20px">

This allows you to evaluate TotalSpaces's functionality and decide whether you want to buy it or not.

## The license agreement

When you buy a TotalSpaces license you get my permission to use the software. Here is [the legal code](/license.txt).

<div class="license-desk">
<p>You may use your license in either of two ways:</p>
<div class="choice">1. <strong>one user on multiple computers</strong> <span class="note">(as long as you are the only user using TotalSpaces)</span></div>
<div class="example">Example: a desktop computer and a personal laptop which are both used exclusively by you</div>
<div class="choice">2. <strong>multiple users on a single computer</strong></div>
<div class="example">Example: a home computer which is shared by all family members</div>
</div>

Please visit [the store](https://sites.fastspring.com/switchstep/instant/totalspaces) where you can purchase TotalSpaces. It is easy and safe (powered by [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com)).

## TotalSpaces updates

When you buy a license you may freely update to all TotalSpaces versions within one major OS release. For example by buying TotalSpaces today you will get free updates for all versions compatible with Lion (OS X 10.7).  If there are not large changes to the operating system to prevent it, TotalSpaces will be updated to support Mountain Lion and the update will be free of charge.

A new major OS release (after OS X Mountain Lion) may require substantial rewrites and intensive testing. I may charge existing users an upgrade fee for a new OS. I expect it to be 50% of the full price.

## TotalSpaces and your privacy

TotalSpaces does not connect to or communicate over the network. It works perfectly on a computer disconnected from the internet.

There are two cases in which TotalSpaces optionally sends data over the network:

* [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/) updating system - when checking and downloading a new version.
* [Crash Reporting](http://blog.binaryage.com/crash-reporting-in-binaryage) dialog - when you explicitly click "Send Report..." button. TotalSpaces uses the same system as TotalFinder.

## TotalSpaces reliability

I have tested TotalSpaces with my system and I did my best to make it bug-free and stable. However it may still contain undiscovered bugs or issues.

<div class="license-warning">
Also please note that I'm not in control of what Apple does with the operating system in the future. Although unlikely, it may happen that some future update makes it impossible for me to adapt TotalSpaces or some of its functionality to a new operating system version. By using this software you accept this risk.
</div>

<div class="license-exclamation">
You are using TotalSpaces at your own risk. I'm not responsible for anything bad which could possibly happen using this software.
