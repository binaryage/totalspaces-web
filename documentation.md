## TotalSpaces provides a grid of spaces on your Mac

<img src="/images/grid-view.png">

An easy to use 2D grid of desktops, inspired by the implementation in OS X Snow Leopard. Navigate using the cursor keys, choose your transitions, and quickly access a birds eye view of your grid of spaces where you can manage your application windows.

Having a grid of spaces allows you to keep a mental picture of where each of your applications is, and to navigate easily and quickly between them.

TotalSpaces lives in an icon in your menu bar, like this:

From there, you can control TotalSpaces, and access the preferences where you can set up your grid, and configure your desktops just how you like them.

TotalSpaces allows you to easily navigate between your spaces, by swiping, with hotkeys, or by just moving your mouse the the edge of the screen in the direction you wish to move.
