## Reset to defaults

Button `Reset TotalFinder to defaults` will restore the initial TotalFinder configuration for all features. This does not remove your license key.

## File Browser

### Show System Files

Enables display of hidden files. More in [Show System Files](/show-system-files).

### Folders on Top

In browser views, displays folders first and then files. More in [Folders on Top](/folders-on-top).

### Always Maximize

By default OSX applications maximize to take available space but they don't take more space than they actually need to display without scrollbars.

When checked, clicking the green maximize button in the top left window frame corner will maximize TotalFinder to the full available screen space.

When unchecked, you may also hold SHIFT and click the green button to maximize to full screen as if it were checked.

### Toggle Dual Mode

Dual mode is covered in a separate article about [Dual Mode in TotalFinder](/dual-mode).

## Menu and Dock

### Hide icon in Menu Bar

By default TotalFinder displays a small icon in the Menu Bar. It shows an auxiliary menu when clicked. You may hide the icon to conserve Menu Bar space.

### Keep original Dock icon

If you don't like the TotalFinder icon in the Dock, you may switch back to the original Finder icon.

If you use some icon replacement pack (like CandyBar), please note that you have to restart Finder to see your custom icons after checking this option.

## Experimental

### Freelance Windows

By default TotalFinder forces all new Finder windows to be opened as new tabs of the last active TotalFinder window. Please note that new Finder windows can be opened as a result of some event. For example clicking on a `dmg file` opens a new Finder window.

After checking this option newly created windows start as new windows.

In the future there will be a better way to specify behavior of new Finder windows. For more information [see the discussion](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/topics/what_does_freelance_window_preference_mean).

### Use narrow Tabs Bar

For people who are running OSX on small notebooks with small displays. Checking this option makes TotalFinder's tab bar smaller and saves 14 pixels of precious vertical space.
