I take requests for features over at [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage). Although I can't promise anything, I will do my best for any reasonable feature requests. Below are some things that have been requested, and that I think would be good to add. Again, I can't promise by particular dates or versions though.


## Naming desktops

Right now the system names your desktops for you, but it's nice to name your own desktops.

## Rearranging desktops by dragging

It would be convenient to be able to rearrange the desktops by dragging them around in the overview grid.

## Other mouse buttons

Some users have multi-button mice - allow the overview grid to be triggered by 4th and 5th buttons also.

## Magic mouse support

Allow two finger swiping for this device.

## More correct space change animations

Simulate diagonal transitions by making one vertical and one horizontal animation.

## Option for transitions to show in the commanded direction

Rather than show which way the grid is moving when circulating, show the transition in the direction that was commanded by the user.

## Translations

TotalSpaces in your language

## Window titles

Show window titles when hovering on the window in the overview grid.

***And many more features...***
