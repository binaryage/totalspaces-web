I take requests for features over at [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage). Although I can't promise anything, I will do my best for any reasonable feature requests. Below are some things that have been requested, and that I think would be good to add. Again, I can't promise by particular dates or versions though.


## App window dragging

Windows could be able to be dragged from desktop to desktop via the edges of the screen, both up and down as well as the existing Lion support for left and right.

## Naming desktops

Right now the system names your desktops for you, but it's nice to name your own desktops.

## Mountain Lion

We fully support Mountain Lion. There may be some minor issues, please report anything you find on [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage)
