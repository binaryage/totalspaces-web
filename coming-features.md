subtitle: Coming / Requested features

I take requests for features over at [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage). Although I can't promise anything, I will do my best for any reasonable feature requests. Below are some things that have been requested, and that I think would be good to add. Again, I can't promise by particular dates or versions though.

## Full screen apps

Although TotalSpaces supports full screen apps, they could be visualised in the select grid view, and with more options as to how they can be navigated to.

## Multi monitors

The select grid could show both (or all) monitors' contents, not just the main screen.

## App window dragging

Windows could be able to be dragged from desktop to desktop via the edges of the screen, both up and down as well as the existing Lion support for left and right.

## Locking apps to desktops

Although you can lock an app to a desktop using the ctrl-click menu from the icons in your dock, this is very fiddly, and we wish to bring control of which app resides where inside the preferences of TotalSpaces.

## Naming desktops

Right now the system names your desktops for you, but it's nice to name your own desktops.

## Gesture support

Changing desktops with gestures.

## Mountain Lion

We intend to fully support Mountain Lion.
