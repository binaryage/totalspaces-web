TotalSpaces allows you to set hotkeys for going Left, Right, Up and Down in your grid of desktops, and for opening the [Overview Grid](/overview).

You can click inside the hotkey recorder to change the hotkey setting.

Some hotkey combinations are already reserved - TotalSpaces will warn you about this if it's the case, and give you the option to try to force assignment of the hotkey, as some system hotkeys are still marked as reserved by the system even when they are not being used.
