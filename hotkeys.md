TotalSpaces allows you to set hotkeys for going Left, Right, Up and Down in your grid of desktops, and for opening the [Overview Grid](/overview).

You can also choose to use the center or 3rd button to trigger the grid if you have a 3 button mouse, or even the 4th or 5th buttons if you have those.

And you can set a hotkey to open the [Overview Grid](/overview) and have it switch immediately to Expos√© mode.

You can click inside the hotkey recorder to change the hotkey setting.

Some hotkey combinations are already reserved - TotalSpaces will warn you about this if it's the case, and give you the option to try to force assignment of the hotkey, as some system hotkeys are still marked as reserved by the system even when they are not being used.

You can also set hotkeys for going to a particular space by control-clicking the space buttons in [Layout preferences](/layout).
