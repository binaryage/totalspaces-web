In order to use TotalSpaces to navigate to your full screen apps, you must tick "Navigate right to full screen desktops" in Layout preferences.

Then your full screen apps will appear to be on the right, on the top row of your grid.

So when you are on your top right desktop, you can then use your rightwards hotkey to get to your first full screen app. Circulation also works from the full screen apps - your rightmost full screen app behaves like it is the rightmost desktop of your top row, and you can circulate to the next row or to the beginning of the same row depending on your circulation settings.

Even if you have "Navigate right to full screen desktops" turned off, you can navigate between your full screen apps by hotkeying left and right.

And hotkeying left from your leftmost full screen app will take you back to your top right desktop.

Future versions of TotalSpaces may support full screen apps more fully, see [Coming features](/coming-features)
