## Free licenses for users

I will grant a free license to everyone who meets any of these criteria:

1. **helped directly** in TotalFinder development (e.g. [translators](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors) -> [visit this page](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n) to help with translation)
2. created or significantly **contributed to an open-source project** I've used in TotalFinder
3. is **a public speaker** and sends me a link to his/her talk (must be recorded and publicly available on youtube or similar site)
4. is **a Google engineer** with a valid `someone@google.com` email address<br>- this is my "thanks" for the Chrome project and great meals [at GDD](http://www.google.com/events/developerday)
5. is **an Apple employee** with a valid `someone@apple.com` email address<br>- this is my general "thank you" for making awesome products
6. has **[bitcoins](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/bitcoin-inside-the-encrypted-peer-to-peer-currency.ars)** and wants to [trade them for TotalFinder](http://blog.binaryage.com/trade-totalfinder-bitcoin) - also I offer bitcoin earnings in my [affiliate program](http://blog.binaryage.com/trade-totalfinder-bitcoin)
7. feels that he/she should get a free license for **some other reason** and convinces me

Please [drop me an email](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=Free%20license%20request) and I will send you a free license link if you meet the criteria.

## Free licenses for the press

Journalists and bloggers may apply for a TotalFinder license if they plan to review it.

I love to read articles about TotalFinder and I will be happy to [give you a NFR license](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=NFR%20license%20request) in exchange.
