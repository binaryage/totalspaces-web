## Free licenses for users

I will grant a free license to everyone who meets any of these criteria:

1. **helped directly** in TotalSpaces development
2. created or significantly **contributed to an open-source project** I've used in TotalSpaces
3. is **a public speaker** and sends me a link to his/her talk (must be recorded and publicly available on youtube or similar site)
4. is **a Google engineer** with a valid `someone@google.com` email address<br>- this is my "thanks" for the Chrome project and great meals
5. is **an Apple employee** with a valid `someone@apple.com` email address<br>- this is my general "thank you" for making awesome products
6. feels that he/she should get a free license for **some other reason** and convinces me

Please [drop me an email](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=Free%20TotalSpaces%20license%20request) and I will send you a free license link if you meet the criteria.

## Free licenses for the press

Journalists and bloggers may apply for a TotalSpaces license if they plan to review it.

I love to read articles about TotalSpaces and I will be happy to [give you a NFR license](mailto:support@binaryage.com?subject=NFR%20TotalSpaces%20license%20request) in exchange, although at this point you should be aware that the software is officially beta until it has reached version 1.0.0.

For your articles you may grab any graphics assets you see around. You may also browse these public github projects:
