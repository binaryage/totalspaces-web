TotalSpaces2 fully supports full screen apps, and they will appear in your [overview grid](/overview2). When you make an app fullscreen, it will be added as a new item in your grid, making a new row at the bottom if needed.

You can drag your fullscreen desktops to the position you want them in the [overview grid](/overview2).
